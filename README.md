Research Paper titled "Leveraging VLMs for Optimising Camera Inputs for Surgical Robotic Reinforcement Learning" written as part of course CSC494 while working under Dr. Lueder Khars.
This papers explores how VLMs can be used to optimize camera views for optimal Reinforcement learning of complex 3D surgical robotic tasks and how that could potentially improve VLM reward generation, reaching near human defined reward performance.
